# Set main branch
git branch -M main
```

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `Bond` (or `bond-streams`)
3. Description: "Real-time market data streaming platform for indie quants and AI agents"
4. Public repository
5. Do NOT initialize with README (we have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/OliverTaylor246/Bond.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Create v0.2.0 tag
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release v0.2.0: Indie Quant + On-Chain gRPC MVP"
git push origin v0.2.0
```

## Step 4: Configure GitHub Repository Settings

### General Settings
- **About**: Add description and topics
  - Topics: `market-data`, `real-time`, `streaming`, `crypto`, `quant`, `trading`, `websocket`, `on-chain`, `defi`, `python`
  - Website: (your domain if you have one)
  
### Security
- Enable "Dependency graph"
- Enable "Dependabot alerts"
- Enable "Dependabot security updates"

### Discussions (Optional)
- Enable GitHub Discussions
- Pin "Getting Started for Indie Quants" topic

## Step 5: Create GitHub Release

1. Go to Releases ‚Üí "Create a new release"
2. Tag: `v0.2.0`
3. Title: "v0.2.0 - Indie Quant + On-Chain gRPC MVP"
4. Description: (copy from CHANGELOG.md)
5. Check "Set as the latest release"
6. Publish release

## Step 6: Prepare for PyPI

### Create PyPI Account
1. Sign up at https://pypi.org/account/register/
2. Enable 2FA
3. Generate API token for publishing

### Build Package

```bash
# Install build tools
pip install build twine

# Build distribution
python -m build

# Check package
twine check dist/*
```

### Test on TestPyPI First

```bash
# Upload to TestPyPI
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test install
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ bond-streams
```

### Publish to PyPI

```bash
# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*

# Verify
pip install bond-streams
```

## Step 7: Post-Launch Marketing

### Social Media Announcement

**Twitter/X Post**:
```
üöÄ Launching Bond v0.2 - Real-time market data streaming for indie quants!

‚ú® Natural language ‚Üí live WebSocket streams
üìä Crypto + On-chain + Twitter data
‚ö°Ô∏è Sub-100ms broker latency
üîê HMAC auth + ring buffer replay
üêç Python SDK

Try it: https://github.com/OliverTaylor246/Bond

#algotrading #crypto #python
```

### Reddit Posts

**r/algotrading**:
Title: "Built Bond: NL to real-time market data streams (crypto, on-chain, Twitter)"
- Focus on use cases
- Include quickstart example
- Link to examples

**r/Python**:
Title: "Bond: Real-time WebSocket streaming platform with natural language interface"
- Focus on async Python architecture
- Highlight SDK simplicity
- Show code examples

### Community Outreach

- Post in Discord servers: Quant, Crypto Trading, DeFi Dev
- Share on Hacker News (Show HN)
- Dev.to article with tutorial
- Medium post on architecture

## Step 8: Set Up Monitoring

### GitHub
- Watch for issues/PRs
- Set up notifications
- Monitor Stars/Forks

### PyPI
- Monitor download stats
- Watch for package issues

## Step 9: Prepare Hosted Service Waitlist

### Simple Landing Page Options
- Tally.so form
- Typeform
- Google Forms
- Cal.com for demo calls

### Waitlist Questions
1. Name & Email
2. Primary use case (algo trading, research, ML, other)
3. Data sources needed
4. Estimated streams/month
5. Company/Independent

## Step 10: First 10-20 Pilot Users

### Outreach Strategy
1. Personal network (quant/trading contacts)
2. Reddit DMs to helpful commenters
3. Twitter DMs to interested followers
4. Discord community members
5. Find users of similar tools (Alpaca, Polygon.io, etc.)

### Pilot Program
- Free access for 30-60 days
- Weekly check-ins
- Feature requests priority
- Case study/testimonial opportunity

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Git Push Rejected
```bash
# If remote has commits you don't have
git pull origin main --rebase
git push origin main
```

### PyPI Package Name Taken
- Try `bond-streams`, `bond-data`, `bondstreams`
- Update pyproject.toml name field

### Build Failures
```bash
# Clean build artifacts
rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info
python -m build
```

## Next Steps After Launch

1. **Week 1**: Monitor issues, respond quickly, fix bugs
2. **Week 2**: Engage with early users, collect feedback
3. **Month 1**: Plan v0.3 features based on feedback
4. **Month 2**: Launch pilot program for hosted service
5. **Month 3**: Iterate based on pilot feedback

## Metrics to Track

- GitHub Stars/Forks
- PyPI downloads
- Issue resolution time
- Community engagement
- Pilot user retention
- Feature requests
